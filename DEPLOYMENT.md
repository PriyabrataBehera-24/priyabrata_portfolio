# Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed ✅

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Fixed by running `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. **React Version Conflicts**: Resolved using legacy peer dependencies flag
3. **Build Configuration**: Added multiple deployment configuration files
4. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Identified (9 vulnerabilities present but not blocking deployment)

## Current Status

- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Static assets ready
- ✅ Production bundle created

## Deployment Options

### 1. Netlify Deployment

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. The `netlify.toml` file is configured with:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `build`
   - Node version: 18
   - SPA redirects configured

### 2. Vercel Deployment

1. Import your project to Vercel
2. The `vercel.json` file handles:
   - Static file routing
   - SPA fallback to index.html
   - Proper asset serving

### 3. GitHub Pages

1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will:
   - Build the project automatically
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages on push to main/master

### 4. Docker Deployment

Build and run with Docker:
```bash
docker build -t portfolio-app .
docker run -p 80:80 portfolio-app
```

### 5. Static File Server

For local testing or simple hosting:
```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

## Build Output

- Bundle size: ~458KB (gzipped)
- CSS: ~1.6KB (gzipped)
- All assets optimized for production

## Notes

- Using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag due to React 19 compatibility issues with some packages
- One warning about missing source map (non-critical)
- Security vulnerabilities present but don't prevent deployment
- All deployment configurations include SPA routing support
